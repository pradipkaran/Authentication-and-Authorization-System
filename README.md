# Authentication and Authorization System
 In this authentication and authorization project, I created secure user signup and login functionality using
 bcrypt for password hashing. I used JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication, with middleware ensuring
 route protection.
 Cookies were used To manage sessions. Roles are assigned to users (student,visitor, admin)  based on role
 authorization, users can access matching protected routes - Express.js , Node.js, MongoDB , Postman
